## How Can I Contribute?

### 1. Reporting Bugs
If you find a bug, please open an issue on the GitHub repository. When reporting a bug, please include:
*   A clear and concise description of the bug.
*   Steps to reproduce the behavior.
*   Expected behavior.
*   Actual behavior.
*   Screenshots or error messages if applicable.
*   Your operating system and Python version.

### 2. Suggesting Enhancements
Do you have an idea for a new feature or an improvement to an existing one? We'd love to hear it! Please open an issue on the GitHub repository and:
*   Clearly describe the enhancement.
*   Explain why this enhancement would be useful.

### 3. Setting Up Your Development Environment
To get started with development, please follow the instructions in the `PROJECT_DESCRIPTION.md` file under the "Setup and Installation" section. This will guide you through cloning the repository, setting up a virtual environment, installing dependencies, and configuring environment variables.

### 4. Coding Guidelines
*   **Python Code**: Adhere to [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) for Python code style. We recommend using a linter like `flake8` or `pylint`.
*   **Flask & Jinja2**: Follow existing patterns for Flask routes, Supabase interactions, and Jinja2 templating.
*   **Frontend**: Maintain the existing hacker-themed dark UI. For CSS, try to keep styles organized and modular.
*   **Comments**: Add comments where necessary to explain complex logic, but strive for self-documenting code.

### 5. Pull Request Guidelines
*   **Fork the repository** and create your branch from `main`.
*   **Make your changes** in a new git branch.
*   **Write clear, concise commit messages** that explain the *what* and *why* of your changes.
*   **Ensure your code passes existing tests** and add new tests for new features or bug fixes.
*   **Update documentation** (if applicable) for any new features or changes in behavior.
*   **Submit your pull request** to the `main` branch.
